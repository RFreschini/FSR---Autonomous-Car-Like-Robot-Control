# FSR---Autonomous-Car-Like-Robot-Control

##Guide to test the controller:
1. Add the whole folder in the workspace
2. Open "Main.mlx"
3. Each block represents a different circuit
4. In each block, is possible to choose between the three real model car-like robots and between the three differents approch we did
5. At start of each block, the corrisponding simulink will open and all the plots will not saved automaticaly.

The "Tracciato.mlx" file does the delaunay triangulation. 
In the folders there are already the delaunay triangulation for each circuit and they are the same we tested.

# Example
"Circuito-Matlab\track_matlab.mat" is the file with the global position of the landmarks;
"Circuito-Matlab\Point_new_map_1000.mat" has the delaunay triangulation result.
